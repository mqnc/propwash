# propwash
FPV drone simulator for the web

Everything is still in prototype phase!

* Use WASD as the left stick, mouse as the right stick (need to click into the game window to capture the mouse first)
* Keys 1-4 switch between the different drone control modes with mode 2 as default
* Right click and mouse wheel for camera orbit controls
* If you got stuck, you need to refresh the page 😬
